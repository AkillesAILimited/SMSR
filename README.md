Reposity for "Learning Sparse Masks for Efficient Super-Resolution"

[[arXiv]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.09603)

- Locate and skip redundant computation in SR networks at a fine-grained level for efficient inference.
- Maintain state-of-the-art performance with significant FLOPs reduction and a speedup on mobile devices.
- Efficient implementation of sparse convolution based on **original Pytorch APIs** for easier migration and deployment.

Codes will be released soon. Stay tuned.
